I am a PhD student in computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
I am currently a research assistant advised by Abhinav Bhatele in Parallel Software 
and Systems Group (PSSG). Before starting my PhD at UMD, I was an undergraduate student 
working as an undergraduate research assistant advised by Adnan Ozsoy at Hacettepe University.

My research focuses on high-performance computing. Specifically, I am working on performance 
analysis of parallel applications and HPC systems. Before that, I worked on parallelization 
of string-matching algorithms using Nvidia GPUs.
